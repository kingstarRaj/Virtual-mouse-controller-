# Virtual-mouse-controller-
This AI based project controls the mouse movement using Python,OpenCV and pyautogui with a real-time camera that detects hand landmarks, tracks gesture patterns instead of a physical mouse.
The Gesture-Controlled Virtual Mouse is a software application that allows users to control the computer cursor using hand gestures. By leveraging gesture recognition technology and a camera/sensor, users can navigate the computer interface without the need for a physical mouse. This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
